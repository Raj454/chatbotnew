# Craffteine Assistant Chatbot

## Overview

The Craffteine Assistant is an AI-powered chatbot designed to guide users in creating personalized energy supplement blends. It facilitates a structured conversation to configure custom formulas by selecting format, ingredients, dosage, and blend naming. The application functions as a standalone React app embeddable into a Shopify store, serving as an interactive product configurator. The project aims to provide a seamless and intelligent user experience for custom supplement creation, leveraging AI for dynamic formula generation and dosage personalization.

## Shopify Integration

### Configuration
The app is connected to your Shopify store using these secrets:
- `SHOPIFY_STORE_URL`: Your store URL (crafftein.myshopify.com)
- `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Admin API access token

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/shopify/test` - Test Shopify connection
- `POST /api/shopify/products` - Create product in Shopify

### Product Creation
When a user completes their formula:
1. Formula is saved to local database
2. Product is created in Shopify with:
   - Title: User's formula name
   - Description: Ingredients, dosages, format, sweetener, flavors
   - Tags: custom-formula, craffteine, format, goal
   - SKU: Auto-generated (CRFT-XXXXXX-timestamp)
   - Price: $29.99 (30 Servings)
3. User is redirected to the Shopify product page

### Embed Widget on Shopify Store
Add this script tag to your Shopify theme (before </body>):
```html
<script src="https://YOUR-DEPLOYED-URL/widget.js"></script>
```
This creates a floating chat button that opens the formula builder

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React 18 and TypeScript, using Vite for development and bundling. Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS (via CDN). The application employs a modular component structure with clear separation of concerns for `App.tsx`, `ChatWindow`, `ChatMessage`, and various interactive components like `OptionButton`, `MultiSelectOptions`, `RangeSlider`, and `InlineTextInput`. State management primarily uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) for local state, with `conversationHistoryRef` maintaining chat history for API context.

### Backend Architecture

A lightweight Express.js backend server (`server.js`) runs on port 3001 to securely proxy API requests. This backend handles web search requests to the Brave Search API, preventing API key exposure on the client side and avoiding CORS issues. The backend uses environment variables from `.env` for secure API key storage.

### Conversation Flow

The chatbot implements an intelligent, adaptive conversation flow that guides users through specific steps:
1.  **Goal**: User's primary objective (e.g., focus, energy).
2.  **Format**: Choice between Stick Pack, Capsule, or Pod.
3.  **Routine, Lifestyle, Sensitivities, CurrentSupplements, Experience**: Detailed user profiling for personalization.
4.  **Formula Building**: AI generates 3-6 ingredients with dosage ranges based on goals and format.
5.  **Sweetener/Flavors**: (For Stick Pack only) Selection of natural sweeteners and flavors.
6.  **Formula Naming**: User provides a name for their blend.
7.  **Finalization**: Summary and redirect URL to Shopify.

The AI dynamically adjusts questions and recommendations based on user input, ensuring a personalized experience. The Craffteine AI Assistant acts as a helpful conversational guide, avoiding structured lists and maintaining a natural, human-like interaction style with natural language processing for flexible input parsing and confusion handling. 

**Conversation Memory & Context Handling:**
The AI maintains strict conversation context through a "Prime Directive" system that ensures formula building is always its primary goal. When users ask off-topic questions (weather, news, time, math) or provide casual greetings ("hi", "hello"), the AI:
1. Answers briefly (1 sentence maximum)
2. Immediately returns to the exact component it was asking about before the interruption
3. Never loses track of the conversation flow
4. Never restarts from Goal unless the conversation is truly new
5. Tracks which components have been collected and continues with missing components

The system implements a strict resume protocol after function calls (off-topic questions), ensuring the AI always returns to the same component rather than advancing prematurely.

**Rate Limiting:**
To prevent OpenAI API rate limit errors (30,000 tokens per minute on free tier), the application implements dual-layer rate limiting:

**Client-Side (4-second cooldown between messages):**
When users attempt to send messages too rapidly:
1. The API call is blocked (no message sent to OpenAI)
2. A purple cooldown banner appears with countdown: "Hold up—Emma needs a sec (Xs left)"
3. The input field is disabled with a visual progress bar showing remaining time
4. After 4 seconds, the input automatically re-enables and the user can continue
5. The cooldown state is managed via `lastUserRequestAt` ref and `cooldownRemainingMs` state in `App.tsx`

**Server-Side (20 requests/minute):**
Backend API routes are protected with `express-rate-limit` middleware (20 requests per minute per IP).

**User-Friendly Error Messages:**
If rate limits are still exceeded, OpenAI errors are transformed into friendly messages via `formatOpenAIError()`:
- Rate limit: "Whoa, slow down! 😅 I need a quick breather. Please wait a few seconds and try again!"
- Quota exceeded: "Oops, I've hit my daily limit! 😔 Please try again tomorrow or contact support."
- Generic errors: "Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting right now. Please try again in a moment! 💜"

This provides smooth UX while preventing rate limit errors during rapid interactions. The cooldown applies to all user inputs: button clicks, slider adjustments, and free-text messages.

### AI and Personalization

The system leverages OpenAI's **GPT-4o-mini** model for dynamic formula generation and intelligent dosage personalization. This model provides 5x higher rate limits (150,000 tokens/minute vs 30,000) compared to GPT-4o while maintaining excellent performance for conversational tasks. It analyzes user profiles (experience, activity, sensitivities, medications, goals) to suggest ingredient dosages, applying a dosage rubric (e.g., beginner users receive 40-60% of the range). Safety validation clamps AI-recommended dosages within predefined min/max ranges. The system also integrates function calling to answer off-topic questions (e.g., time, date, weather, calculations, web search) before redirecting back to supplement configuration.

### Data Management & Session Persistence

**Database Architecture (PostgreSQL + Drizzle):**
- `formulas` table: Stores user formulas (session_id, customer_id, formula_data, created_at)
- `ingredients` table: Catalog of supplement ingredients with dosage ranges
- `flavors` table: Flavor/sweetener options for Stick Pack format
- `trademark_blacklist` table: Reserved/trademarked names (database-only validation for V1)

**Session Management Service:**
- Guest users: Auto-generated UUID session IDs stored in localStorage
- Logged-in users: Shopify customer ID tracking via localStorage (for future Shopify integration)
- Formula persistence: Auto-save on completion, auto-load on session restart

**API Endpoints (Backend):**
- `POST /api/formulas` - Save formula to database
- `GET /api/formulas/:sessionId` - Retrieve formula by session
- `GET /api/formulas/customer/:customerId` - Get all formulas for a customer
- `GET /api/trademark/check/:name` - Validate formula name availability
- `GET /api/ingredients` - Get all available ingredients
- `GET /api/flavors` - Get all available flavors

Inventory data for flavors and powders is managed via database, seeded on startup. `services/inventoryService.ts` handles stock data, which is dynamically integrated into the OpenAI context, allowing Emma to provide real-time availability and filter options based on format.

## External Dependencies
